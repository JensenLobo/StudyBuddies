# SudyBuddies Group Application


***Description:


This is a website that allows students to form study groups based on their majors.


***Features:


- When users visit the website, they will have the option to create an account.


- When the user is creating an account, the user email should end with "@uncc.edu" or else they will not be able to create an account.


- While creating an account, the user has to make their password at least 8 characters long and of course, the password will be hashed


- After the user creates their account, when the user logs in they will be asked to select their major and their first/last name. Then they will direct them to the home page and the home page welcomes the user with their first and last name. In the navbar, the user can change their major, go to the general discussion page, or go to the discussion page directly related to their major, or select the setting button.


- They also have to remember their password or else they will not be able to login to their account.


- In the duscussion page, users can make a post and all students that are in the major will be able to see and interact with the post. A post displays the user's name on top, message, and the date and time it was posted. Each user has the ability to update their posts. Other users that see the post have the option to like or dislike it.


- In the navbar, users have the option to go back to the home page, or visit the general discussion page. There is also a settings button on the top right corner that gives the users an option to sign out or delete their account. If a user deletes their account, all of their data wil be erased including their posts on the discussion pages.


- Users can only access the discussion page that is linked to their major. However, all users have access to the general discussion page as well. The general discussion page has the same features and allows every single user to reach out and communicate with each other.


- A user is allowed to switch their major, but they can only do it once. However, let's say you were a computer science major and you wanted to switch to business. If you decide to do this then once you switch, your posts that you posted on the computer science discussion page will be available on the computer science major discussion page. This is done because your post might still be helpful for other students.
